<p>I'm not entirely sure what to introduce myself as? I go by a lot of names online, but I think most people know me as Nox. I picked the nickname in middle school after seeing it in a book, and I've just sort of kept it ever since.
<p>I made the "space station" because I wanted a place away from social media. I'm not the type to post on socials often (or at all) and starting a project like this felt a lot more personal? If that makes sense? That said, everything here is very experimental as I really don't know what I'm doing.. It is definitely a learning process, but it's fun and that's what matters !!</p>
